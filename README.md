## Overview
The True Momentum Forex Robot is designed to analyze momentum in the Forex market and generate buy and sell signals based on the momentum analysis. It utilizes digital filtering techniques to differentiate and filter out noise in the market data, providing more accurate signals.

## Features
- Calculates momentum based on designated parameters and formulas.
- Implements digital filtering techniques to filter out noise in market data.
- Generates buy and sell signals based on momentum analysis.
- Displays momentum oscillations graphically on the user interface.

## Installation
To use the True Momentum Forex Robot, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries `Trade.mqh` and `MovingAverages.mqh`.
2. Create an instance of the `TrueMomentum` class.
3. Define an array of prices for testing.
4. Calculate momentum using the `CalculateMomentum` method.
5. Filter the momentum using the `FilterMomentum` method.
6. Generate buy and sell signals using the `GenerateSignals` method.
7. Display momentum graphically using the `DisplayMomentumGraph` method.

## Usage
To use the True Momentum Forex Robot, you can modify the code as per your requirements. Here is an example of how to use the code:

```cpp
// Create an instance of the TrueMomentum class
TrueMomentum trueMomentum;

// Define array of prices for testing
double[] prices = {1.2345, 1.2350, 1.2340, 1.2360, 1.2370};

// Calculate momentum
double momentum = trueMomentum.CalculateMomentum(prices, 2);

// Filter momentum
double filteredMomentum = trueMomentum.FilterMomentum(momentum);

// Generate signals
trueMomentum.GenerateSignals(filteredMomentum);

// Display momentum graph
trueMomentum.DisplayMomentumGraph();
```

## Technical Details
The True Momentum Forex Robot is built using the MQL programming language. It includes a class called `TrueMomentum` which encapsulates the functionality of the robot. The class has methods for calculating momentum, filtering momentum, generating signals, and displaying momentum graphically. It also utilizes the `Trade` and `MovingAverages` libraries for trading and technical analysis.
